Assumption
----------
The current stray-light correction is only valid for MIRI MRS Short
wavelength data.  The straylight step uses information about which pixels
belong to a slice and which pixels are located in the slice gaps.
This informations  is contained meta data of the input image and was loaded
from a reference file by the assign_wcs step. Thus running the assign_wcs on 
the input data is a prerequisite to  the straylight step.  

Overview
--------
This routine removes and/or otherwise corrects for stray-light that may
contaminate a MIRI MRS short-wavelength spectrum, due a bright source
in the MRS slice
gaps. The current routine determines the stray-light by using signal
in-between slices and  interpolates over the slice.

The chief source of the MIRI MRS stray-light appears to be caused
by scattering in optical components within the SMO. The stray-light is
manifested as a signal that extends in the detector row direction. Its
magnitude is proportional to that of bright illuminated regions of the
spectral image, at a ratio that falls with increasing wavelength,
from about 1 % in Channel 1A to undetectable low levels long-ward of Channel 2B.
Two components of the stray-light have been observed, a smooth and a structured
distribution. 

Algorithm
---------
The basic idea of the stray-light removal algorithm is to only deal with the 
smooth component of the stray-light. Due to the extended nature of the
stray-light we use the detected signal in the slice gaps, where nominally no photons
should hit the detectors, and assume that all detected light is the stray-light. 
Using this measurement, we can interpolate the gap flux within the slice to
estimate the amount of the stray-light in the slice. 

There are two possible algorithms in the stray-light step. The first algorithm is
a more simplistic approach by dealing with the stray-light estimation row-by-row
and interpolating the gap flux linearly. An intermediate stray-light map is 
generated row-by-row and then this map is further smoothed to remove row-by-row
variations. This algorithm uses a stray-light mask reference file that contains
1s for gap pixels and 0s for science pixels.  

Given the extended nature of the smooth component of the MRS stray-light, it
is obvious that a row-by-row handling of the stray-light could be replaced
by a two-dimensional approach such that no additional smoothing is required.
For the second algorithm we improved the technique by using the Modified Shepard's
Method to interpolate the gap fluxes two dimensionally. The stray-light correction
for each science pixel is based on the flux of the gap pixels with a "region of influence"
from the science pixel. The algorithm takes each science pixel and determines the 
amount of stray-light to remove from the pixel  :math:`s`  by interpolating the fluxes :math:`p_i` measured
by the gap pixels. The gap pixel flux is weighted by the distance :math:`d_i` between the science pixel and gap pixel. 
The Modified Shepardâ€™s Method uses this distance to weight the different contributors according the equation:

.. math::

   s = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n p_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}


   w_i =\frac{ max(0,R-d_i)} {R d_i}^ k

The radius of influence :math:`R` and the exponent :math:`k` are variables that 
can be adjusted to the actual problem. The default values for these parameters are
:math:`R = 50` pixels and :math:`k = 1`.
